# Scan Docker Container

 This project aims to elucidate the crucial practices of security and vulnerability checking within Docker containers through the lens of CI/CD pipelines. By integrating automated testing and security scanning into the development workflow, developers can proactively identify and address security vulnerabilities, thereby bolstering the resilience of their applications.

 The pipeline will be designed to execute automated tests, validating the functional aspects of the application, and concurrently performing security scans to scrutinize the containerized environment for potential vulnerabilities. This dual-pronged approach ensures that the development process not only meets functional requirements but also adheres to fundamental security principles.

 By the culmination of this project, participants will have a practical understanding of how to implement an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline that includes automated testing for functional correctness and security scans to fortify Docker containers against potential vulnerabilities. Through this exploration, developers will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to embed security into their development workflows, fostering a proactive and secure approach to containerized application deployment. Let's embark on this journey to integrate security seamlessly into the CI/CD pipeline, fortifying our applications in the ever-evolving landscape of software development.
