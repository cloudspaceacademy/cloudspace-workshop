The \"slim\" variant provides a smaller image size by excluding some non-essential components, making it suitable for many Python applications.</p> <p>WORKDIR /app</p> <p>This line sets the working directory inside the container to /app. This is where the application code and files will be placed, and it's the directory where commands will be executed by default. It's a good practice to organize your application within a dedicated directory.</p> <p>COPY requirements.txt .</p> <p>This line copies the requirements.txt file from the host system into the container. The . at the end specifies the destination path, which is the current directory within the container (i.e., /app).</p> <p>RUN pip install -r requirements.txt</p> <p>This line uses the RUN instruction to execute a command within the container. In this case, it runs pip install -r requirements.txt to install all the Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file. This step ensures that the necessary dependencies are installed in the container.</p> <p>COPY . .</p> <p>This line copies all the files and directories from the current directory (the directory where the Dockerfile is located) on our host system to the /app directory in the container.
